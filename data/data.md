# File descriptions

Due to the extremely large size of this dataset, we have separated the files into multi-part archives. We recommend using 7zip or keka to extract.  Note that the rules do not allow sharing of the data outside of Kaggle, including bittorrent (why not?).

train.zip.* - the training set (5 files total)
test.zip.* - the test set (7 files total)
sample.zip - a small set of images to preview the full dataset
sampleSubmission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
trainLabels.csv - contains the scores for the training set
